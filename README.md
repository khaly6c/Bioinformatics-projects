# 1)Transcriptomic Data Analysis Pipeline

This repository presents a reproducible and modular pipeline for transcriptomic data analysis, implemented in both R and Python.
The project aims to demonstrate practical expertise in computational biology, data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, and biological data visualization.

The workflow is designed for microarray or RNA-seq datasets (e.g., Affymetrix .CEL files) and enables the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between experimental conditions such as control vs disease.

## Objectives

This project illustrates the core analytical steps of a bioinformatics transcriptomic workflow, including:
- Preprocessing and normalization of high-dimensional gene expression data
- Statistical modeling for the detection of DEGs using robust linear models
- Annotation of DEGs with biological identifiers and gene metadata
- Exploratory visualization through clustering and heatmaps
- Cross-validation of results between R and Python implementations

This pipeline emphasizes data integrity, reproducibility, and scientific rigor, mirroring best practices used in research environments.

 ## Key Features

- Quality control and exploratory data visualization (histograms, boxplots, MA plots)

- Background correction and multiple normalization strategies (RMA, quantile, LOESS)

- Differential expression analysis using limma and empirical Bayes statistics

- Gene annotation using Ensembl via biomaRt (exported as DEG.txt)

- Heatmap visualization and hierarchical clustering of top DEGs

- Parallel Python implementation leveraging Scanpy and Statsmodels

## R Implementation

Developed using the Bioconductor ecosystem, the R version focuses on transparency, interpretability, and statistical robustness.

Dependencies:
- affy – preprocessing and background correction
- limma – differential expression analysis
- biomaRt – gene annotation
- gplots, dendextend – visualization and clustering

--

Run the pipeline:

Rscript transcriptomic_analysis.R

--

Output files include:
- Normalized expression matrices
- DEG tables (DEG.txt)
- Heatmaps and cluster dendrograms

## Python Implementation

The Python version mirrors the analytical flow using modern data science frameworks.
It provides flexibility for integration with RNA-seq data and machine learning-based analyses.

Dependencies:

pip install scanpy pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn

Run the pipeline:

python transcriptomic_analysis.py

The Python workflow performs:
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- DEG identification using linear modeling
- Visualization with heatmaps and PCA

## Scientific Context

This project was developed as part of an academic initiative focused on bioinformatics research and data-driven biology.
It integrates techniques from transcriptomics, statistics, and machine learning to extract biological insights from high-throughput data.

The pipeline can be extended to incorporate:
- RNA-seq differential expression (DESeq2 or EdgeR)
- Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis
- Machine learning-based classification of gene expression profiles
